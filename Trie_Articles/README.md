*********************************************************
A file, companies.dat, contains a list of company names on each line. 
Company names may have multiple words in the name. Sometimes, a company might have multiple names associated with it. 
The first name is the primary name, and the remainder are synonyms. 
In this case, the company names will be separated by a tab on the same line. (Create a sample version of this file for your testing. The final file used for grading is not published.)
