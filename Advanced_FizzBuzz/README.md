# Assignment description
Create a function called FizzBuzzer that takes a sequential container of integer numbers as its only parameter.

Tip: For JavaScript programmers, the quintessential sequential container is an array.

For each number in the sequence, output the number to the screen. However, if the number is divisible by 3, output the word Buzz instead of the number. If the number is divisble by 5, output Fizz to the screen instead of the number. If the number is divisible by both, output BuzzFizz to the screen instead of the number.

In your main code, call the function with an sequence consisting of the numbers between 10 and 250. Do not hard code this sequence using an array literal, but rather use code to generate the sequence.
